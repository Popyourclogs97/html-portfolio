<h1>My Hobbies</h1>

<h2>Gaming</h2>
I Would say this is my biggest hobby of all, gaming has always been a big part of my life. I even met my partner through gaming.
I've played since I was a kid, using things like the Gameboy all the way up to now playing on my own PC fully put together by me.
Competitive gaming is my main passion, i really got into CS:GO and ever since then i've been hooked on competitive games. My most recent being Rust. <br/>

<h2>Investing/trading</h2>
I've been interested in cryptocurrency ever since i found out about it in 2018. Knowing what I know now i wished i'd of kept the majority of BTC that i'd got around that time! (i'd be alot more wealthy)
As crypto has evolved i've been learning more and keeping up to date with it, researching about what actually is cryptocurrency and how it works & also how you can trade with it to make money.

<h2>Riding e-bikes & e-steps</h2>
A more recent hobby of mine is riding bikes and scooters, specifically E-bikes and scooters (steps)
I've recently moved to Belgium where these vechiles are legally allowed to be used and owned privately by the public, not just for use on private land but as a means of transport. Through owning them i've learnt more about how they work, how to repair certain problems and also i've learnt more about my area which i've moved too as i've spent alot of time riding around different areas just enjoying these vechiles.
Here's a picture of my most recent purchase. <br/>

<h2>Making Latte art</h2>
Another more recent hobby of mine is making latte art. I'd never drank lattes before meeting my partner, but she suggested to go to a cafe and get a latte. Ever since then i've been hooked. I've taught myself how to do latte & and spent a bunch of money in the process getting new equipment and different coffee beans! It's now a part of my daily routine.
I wont show you my first ever latte attempts because they look awful, I can however show off my latest! <br/>
