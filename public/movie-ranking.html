<h1>The best Movies & Series according to Kyle</h1>
<h2>My top Movies & series of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Peaky Blinders</h3>
<p>This is probably my favorite show of all time, the time it's set in & how the characters play their roles is 10/10. <br />
The only thing i wish is that there were more seasons.</p>
<h3>Game of Thrones</h3>
<p>I'd say this is tied with the number one spot, everything about this series is next level.<br />
The battles, the history between houses & the story with the white walkers make this series one of the best of all time for me.</p>
<h3>The Fast and the Furious</h3>
<p>The OG fast and Furious movie has to be up there was one of the greatest movies of all time. <br /> Granted the sequals to this movie have progressivley gotten worse but this movie itself stands out for me from my childhood. <br /> 
Amazing cars and great race scenes, what it should've stayed like!</p>
