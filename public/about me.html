<h2>My Objective</h2>
I'm just starting out with coding and currently learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript through an online course. I've been into PC gaming since I was a kid, and over time that turned into an interest in how games and websites are actually made. One day I'd love to be part of a project that listens to its community and makes something people really care about. For now, I'm focused on building my first projects and learning as much as I can
